<!-- Here is a short text about Australia's Geography -->
<pre style="margin:auto; font-size:26px;" class="geohead"><b>Geography, landscape, and biomes</b></pre>
<pre style="margin:auto;" class="geo">The <strong>geography</strong> of Australia encompasses a wide variety of biogeographic regions being the world's smallest continent, while 
comprising the territory of the sixth-largest country in the world. The population of Australia is concentrated along the 
eastern and south-eastern coasts. The geography of the continent is extremely diverse, ranging from the snow-capped mountains 
of the Australian Alps and Tasmania to large deserts, tropical and temperate forests, grasslands, heathlands and woodlands. 

Australia is a continent and an island located in Oceania between the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean. 
It shares its name with the country that claims control over it. The territory consists of the entire continent 
and smaller outlying islands, making it the sixth-largest country in the world by area 
of jurisdiction, which comprises <strong>7,686,850 km2 (2,967,910 sq mi)</strong>.</pre>

<b>Historical Background</b></pre>
<pre style="margin:auto; font-size:18.72px;" class="hishead3"><b>Prehistory</b></pre>
<pre style="margin:auto;" class="his">
Humans are thought to have arrived in Australia about <strong>30,000</strong> years ago. The original inhabitants, who have descendants to this 
day, are known as <i><b>aborigines</b></i>. In the eighteenth century, the aboriginal population was about 300,000.
The aborigines, who have been described alternately as nomadic hunter-gatherers and fire-stick farmers 
(known for using fire to clear the brush and attract grass-eating animals instead of cultivating the land), 
settled primarily in the well-watered coastal areas. Some observers believe that poor treatment of the environment by 
aborigines over many centuries may have led to the barren nature of much of the Australian interior. Higher forms of 
mammals never reached Australia because the land bridge from Asia ceased to exist about <b>50 million years ago</b>.

<pre style="margin:auto; font-size:18.72px;" class="hishead3"><b>European Settlement</b></pre>
<pre style="margin:auto;" class="his">
The period of European discovery and settlement began on <b>August 23, 1770</b>, when <b>Captain James Cook of the 
British Royal Navy</b> took possession of the eastern coast of Australia in the name of George III. 
His party had spent four months in exploration along eastern Australia, from south to north. 
Unlike Dutch explorers, who deemed the land of doubtful value and preferred to focus on the 
rich Indies to the north, Cook and Joseph Banks of the Royal Society, who accompanied Cook for 
scientific observations, reported that the land was more fertile. Cookâ€™s fame in Britain helped to 
fix the attention of the British government on the area, which had some strategic significance in the 
European wars of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
